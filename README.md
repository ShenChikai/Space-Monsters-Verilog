# Nexy4 Project: Space-Monsters-Verilog

The game is inspired by the classic arcade game "Space Invaders." The game involves a shooter which can only move at the bottom of the screen, and monsters emerging from the top of the screen. Both monsters and the player continuously fire bullets. For simplicity the monsters are also at a fixed position at the beginning. If time allows, we can add more features including moving monsters and different levels of the game.
